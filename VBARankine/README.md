**Example 8.1: Analyzing an Ideal Rankine Cycle  Page 438**

   * Steam is the working fluid in an ideal Rankine cycle. 

   * Saturated vapor enters the turbine at 8.0 MPa 
   
   * Saturated liquid exits the condenser at a pressure of 0.008 MPa. 

   * The net power output of the cycle is 100 MW.

   * Cooling water enters the condenser at 15°C and exits at 35°C.

* Determine for the cycle

  * the thermal efficiency, %

  * the back work ratio,  %

  * the mass flow rate of the steam,in kg/h,

  * the rate of heat transfer, Qin, into the working fluid as it passes through the boiler, in MW,

  * the rate of heat transfer, Qout, from the condensing steam as it passes through the condenser, in MW,

  * the mass flow rate of the condenser cooling water, in kg/h
